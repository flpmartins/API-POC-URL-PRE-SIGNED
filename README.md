POC Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my "POC" API, a cool project I'm working on to learn about AWS S3. This API, crafted with Node.js and Express, is all about creating signed URLs for secure access to resources. It's not finished yet, but it's buzzing with potential! ðŸš€

Features AWS S3 Exploration: Dive into the AWS S3 world and discover how to generate signed URLs for super-secure resource access.

Tech Stack: Built with the awesomeness of Node.js and Express.

How to Use Clone the Repo: git clone https://github.com/flpmartins/POC Install Dependencies: npm install Run the Server: npm run dev Explore the API: Access /health to check if the server is up and /aws/signed-url-upload to generate signed URLs. Feel free to experiment, tweak, and learn alongside me as we embark on this AWS S3 adventure! ðŸš€
